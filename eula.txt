INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

All code, designs, and resources (excluding those owned by others, such as placeholder resources listed near the beginning of the document) are owned by Aaron, and
    you agree not to claim them to be your own.

The AaronOS logos and other text- or image-based branding are not to modified in such a way that makes it difficult for users to understand that the project is, in fact, AaronOS.
Examples of acceptable logo or branding modification include but are not limited to:
    - modifying the visual style to portray a unique theme
    - utilizing the backdrop design of the AaronOS icons to create your own unique icons, but not changing the meaning of existing icons
    - creating an identity for your own changes to AaronOS that does not appear to change the identity of the project as a whole
Examples of unacceptable logo or branding modification include but are not limited to:
    - modifications that make it difficult for users to understand that AaronOS is the original work
        - an example includes changing or removing text or images that are important to identifying the original work, such as the AaronOS logo or Aaron's name
    - modifications that appear to change the identity of AaronOS, or appear to change the identity of existing AaronOS content
        - an example includes rebranding AaronOS, or rebranding AaronOS content such as NORAA, under a different name
    - modifications that appear to convey ownership of AaronOS to anyone other than Aaron Adams, the original creator of AaronOS
        - an example includes changing the name or logo of AaronOS, especially when the changes seem to convey that the original work belongs to someone other than Aaron
